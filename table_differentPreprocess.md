### Results of different Preprocessing methods
|  New Preprocessing method  |   Resample     | Histogram Equlization |    No  |  
|:--------------:|:-----------:|:---------------:|:-----------:|
| Accuracy on dataset_1   |      95.84%      |   88.03%     |    94.71%    |
| Accuracy on dataset_2  |   90.30%      |     89.35%        |     90.20%    |  
| Accuracy on dataset_3  |   87.58%    |        83.75%    |      88.28%    | 

*Except the new methods listed in the table, the remaining part of the program is the same as that in the "Beginner Level"\
*For dataset_2 and dataset_3, the classifier is trained using training set and tested using another testing set\
 Dataset_1 hasn't been devided into training set and testing set , so it is tested by k_fold validation
